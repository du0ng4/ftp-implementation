server side:
1. create welcome socket
2. accept connection from client to another socket (control channel)
3. receive port information and command from client for data channel
4. create new socket and connect to client (data channel)
5. respond to command (send back data over data channel or begin receiving data from data channel)
6. print out SUCCESS/FAILURE
7. close data connection
8. go back to step 3 if client sends more valid commands
9. close control channel otherwise

client side:
1. create control socket and connect to server at server's welcome socket (connection between client control socket and server new socket)
2. take user input for commands and check if valid
3. for valid commands, create new socket, send port info and command to server over control channel
3.5 data connection is opened
4. receive response from server/upload file
5. print filename and number of bytes transferred
6. close data connection
7. go back to step 2, loop until command quit
8. close control connection
